        <h1>Taarlo</h1>
        <p><i>by Herman de Coninck</i></p>
        <P>We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.<br>and in spring too I feel no different.<br>We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves<br>trough much dark-red loss,<i>appellation controlee,</i></p>
        <p>that deepens in the cellar of the years.<br>We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.<br>Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees<br>sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.</p>
        <p>33, and in the midst of the Dark wood<br>of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging,<br>at home in the woods and desolate at home.</p>
        <p>Will we one day, maybe, ever?<br>The summer is past, the hay-making is over.<br>The here is nowhere, and the now is never.</p>
        <p>From <i>Sounding like an Oboe</i>(Met een klank van hobo, 1980)<br><i>Translated by Tanis Guest</i></p>
        <p>Even more something</p>
